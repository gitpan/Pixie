Guess what, you can install Pixie just like any other well behaved
CPAN module using the standard incantations:

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ sudo make install

But, that doesn't get everything tested. To that end we offer an
environment variable, allowing you to specify which database backends
you want to test against. Just set PIXIE_TEST_STORES to be a space
seperated list of DBI specs. (NB: we assume these test databases can
be accessed with no passwords.)

You'll need to set up the initial tables that Pixie needs though, to
do this, after you've done the 'make', do

   $ perl -Mblib ./deploy_pixie.pl DBISPEC USER PASS

Which will set up an appropriate set of tables. Note that you can
specify a username and password here, in case you need extra
permissions to create tables. This will create 3 tables: px_object,
px_lock_info and px_rootset (Pixie defaults to using the px_ prefix
for all sorts of things.)

Once that's done, you're ready to roll.
