==================
 Pixie Test Suite
==================

The test framework is organized as follows:

    t/*.t	test scripts
    t/lib/	test classes & common code
    t/tmp/	temporary stuff that should go away with 'make clean'
    t/TODO	todo notes

In general, we like to test each class individually and we try to take a
ground-up kind of approach (test classes that are used by other classes
first).

The tests are grouped as follows:

    00 - 09	framework or very basic tests
    10 - 29	misc. supporting objects
    30 - 39	proxy objects
    40 - 49	lock strategies
    50 - 59	storage backends
    60 - 69	pixie & friends
    70 - 89	full system tests
    95 - 99	admin

Don't be afraid to re-number tests or re-arrange the framework if it makes
sense to.
