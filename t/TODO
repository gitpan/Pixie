=======================
 Pixie Test Suite Todo
=======================

55-57 DBI Stores:
    o	test verify_connection(), reconnect(), clear()

xx_pixie.t

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   o    resolve diffs between t/lib/Sunnydale.pm's Person and t/lib/Person.pm
   o    use Test::More 'no_plan'; # save us from maths!
   o    re-order all tests so that more basic tests are done first.

Review tests 70-90 and remove redundant tests.

Remove dependency on Test::Class. ?

Consider renaming 'Common' to 'Framework'.
Add UNIVERSAL::px_is_managed to framework, or Pixie::Complicity?

    +	uses Test::Class

01memory.t (72_is_managed.t)
    +	a bunch of px_is_managed tests
    +	for all defined stores (so horribly named)

02nonhash.t (73_array_objs.t)
    +	array object. only seems to use memory store.

03berkeley.t (80_bdb_store.t)
    +	tests bdb store, not sure what's different from 00simple.t

04array.t (83_array.t)
    ?	weird tests using Springfield.pm, no idea what it does at a glance.

05flatarray.t (84_flat_array.t)
    ?	weird tests using Springfield.pm, no idea what it does at a glance.

06flathash.t (85_flat_hash.t)
    ?	weird tests using Springfield.pm, no idea what it does at a glance.

07cache.t (86_cache.t)
    +	based on Sunnydale.pm, a lot of leaktests, making sure oid's are right
	and a lot of 'as_string' overload tests of the framework

08names.t (74_names.t)
    +	binding names to objs & retreiving them

09deep.t (75_deep.t)
    +	store a 'deep' object (ie: obj nested within an obj)

09deep.class.t (76_deep_class.t)
    +	same as 'deep' only with more 'is_managed' tests
    +	uses Test::Class

10safeoids.t (77_safe_oids.t)
    +	creates a 'SimpleArray', does some 'is_managed' tests, and checks to see
    	if Pixie's copy is the same as a deep copy of the obj.
    +	uses Test::Class

11dbistore.t (81_dbi_stores.t)
    +	generic tests for all DBI stores defined
    +	uses Test::Class

12complicity.t (87_complicity.t)
    +	for all defined stores
    +	tests different types of closures

13concurrency.t (82_dbi_concurrency.t)
    +	tests locking
    +	for all defined DBI stores
    +	really needs updating to reduce timeouts

15rootset.t (78_rootset.t)
    +	simple test, checks contents of the 'rootset'
    +	for all defined stores
    +	uses Test::Class

16workingset.t (79_workingset.t)
    +	tests $px->neighbours, $px->rootset, $px->live_set, $px->working_set
    +	for all defined stores except 'memory'
    +	uses Test::Class
